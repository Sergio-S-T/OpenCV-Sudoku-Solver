# OpenCV-Sudoku-Solver

Sudoku solver programmed with Python using OpenCV for image recognition. The base image that contains the sudoku is processed using the OpenCV library to detect the puzzle, and then using a neural network each number is analyzed to build the matriz to be solved. After a solution is found, the result is printed over the original image again.

Example of the code's output:
